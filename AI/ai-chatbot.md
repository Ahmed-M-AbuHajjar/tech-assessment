# AI Chatbot Feature

## Purpose
Allow users to ask questions about their tasks and projects using natural language.

## Implementation
- Route: `/dashboard/chat`
- Simple chat UI with message list and input.
- Backend endpoint (to be implemented) will process user queries and return AI-generated answers.
- For now, the response is stubbed.

## Reasoning
- Provides a modern, interactive way for users to get information quickly.
- Lays the groundwork for future integration with LLMs or custom AI services.
- Keeps the UI/UX consistent with the rest of the portal.
